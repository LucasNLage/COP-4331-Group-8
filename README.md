# COP-4331-Group-8 (Manage Bandage)
A collaborative project to make a functional website using a WISA stack.
We're using Microsoft Azure™️ to manage our API and SQL database.

## Project Requirements:
- Remote Database
- Use any stack: WISA, LAMP, and MEAN are preferred.
- The program is a personal contact manager. Each user needs a login. For each user, they can add their own contacts (not shared contacts). They can search for and delete contacts.
- Use JSON to communicate between client and server. During the presentation, you must show access to one API endpoint using ARC or CURL.
- You will use a web page as the client. (A web page must be AJAX enabled that accesses the API.)
- The user interface should be clean and professional. The project should be as professional as possible. The source and support files must be in github (You will add the link to the sign up sheet). 

## Team Roles
The team is split into roles so that we specify on one area, as we would in a software engineering job.
The roles are as follows:
- Project Manager/Hosting: Lucas
- Front End: Will, Jesse
- Back End: Alejandro
- JavaScript/Functionality: Selena
- Design: Alejandro
- Database Design/Implementation: David & Courtney
- API Development: Isaac & Lucas
- Testing, Requirements, and Documentation: Lucy
